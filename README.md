# Cribbage
The mathematically perfect way to play cribbage


Hello, this is my first larger project where my goal was to create a very accurate way of playing Cribbage.

This is a link which shows you the process I went through with creating this project.

This is meant to be run in Unity, I didnt want to upload the entirety of the project, as all textures and stuff were hand made, and my internet doesnt have the best upload speed.
